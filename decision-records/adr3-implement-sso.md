# Architecture Decision Record (ADR3)

## Decision: Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) for Authentication

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
The exam delivery system requires a seamless and secure authentication mechanism to allow users to access the application without needing to manage multiple sets of credentials.

## Decision:
Single Sign-On (SSO) will be implemented to enable users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications within the exam delivery system without the need for repeated authentication.

## Consequences:
**Positive:**
- Enhanced User Experience: SSO simplifies the authentication process for users, reducing the need to remember multiple sets of credentials and improving user satisfaction.
- Improved Security: SSO can enhance security by centralizing authentication and enforcing consistent authentication policies across applications, reducing the risk of password-related security breaches.
- Streamlined Administration: SSO simplifies user management and administration by centralizing authentication and user provisioning, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring consistency.
- Increased Productivity: SSO eliminates the need for users to repeatedly authenticate when accessing multiple applications, saving time and improving productivity.

**Negative:**
- Dependency on Identity Provider: SSO introduces a dependency on the identity provider (IdP), and any downtime or issues with the IdP may impact the availability of the exam delivery system.
- Integration Complexity: Integrating with multiple applications and services to support SSO may require additional development effort and complexity, especially for legacy systems or applications without native SSO support.

**Risks:**
- Security Risks: Inadequate implementation or configuration of SSO could introduce security vulnerabilities such as session hijacking or unauthorized access if not properly managed and monitored.
- User Experience Impact: Poorly implemented SSO could lead to user frustration and usability issues if authentication workflows are not intuitive or if users encounter errors during the authentication process.
