# Architecture Decision Record (ADR2)

## Decision: Utilize Azure Event Grid for Event-Driven Architecture

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
The system needs to support asynchronous communication between microservices to ensure loose coupling and flexibility in a cloud environment.

## Decision:
Azure Event Grid was chosen as the event-driven architecture solution for its native integration with Azure services, including microservices deployed on AKS, enabling efficient and reliable asynchronous communication through events.

## Consequences:
**Positive:** 
- Loose coupling between microservices facilitates flexibility and scalability, enabling seamless integration and communication across the system.

**Negative:** 
- Complexity in managing event routing and subscription configurations may increase operational overhead.

**Risks:** 
- Dependency on Azure Event Grid for inter-service communication may introduce potential latency and reliability issues if not properly configured and monitored.
