# Architecture Decision Record (ADR6)

## Decision: Use Elasticsearch as the Database for the Audit Log API

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
The system requires a robust and scalable solution for storing and querying audit log data to track all actions performed within the system for auditing and compliance purposes.

## Decision:
Elasticsearch was chosen as the database solution for the Audit Log API to efficiently store, search, and analyze large volumes of log data in real-time.

## Consequences:
**Positive:**
- **Scalability:** Elasticsearch is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing the system to handle large volumes of log data and scale seamlessly as the system grows.
- **Real-time Search:** Elasticsearch provides fast and real-time search capabilities, enabling users to quickly retrieve and analyze audit log data based on various search criteria.
- **Full-text Search:** Elasticsearch supports full-text search, allowing users to perform complex queries and aggregations on log data, including keyword searches, filtering, and sorting.
- **Aggregation and Analysis:** Elasticsearch offers powerful aggregation capabilities for summarizing and analyzing log data, such as grouping by fields, calculating metrics, and generating visualizations.
- **Integration Ecosystem:** Elasticsearch integrates seamlessly with other tools and technologies commonly used in microservices architectures, such as Logstash for log ingestion and Kibana for visualization and analytics.

**Negative:**
- **Complexity:** Setting up and managing Elasticsearch clusters may require specialized skills and knowledge, particularly in areas such as data modeling, index optimization, and cluster configuration.
- **Operational Overhead:** Maintaining Elasticsearch clusters involves ongoing tasks such as monitoring, scaling, and troubleshooting, which may add to the operational overhead of the system.

**Risks:**
- **Data Loss:** Inadequate backup and disaster recovery strategies for Elasticsearch clusters may pose a risk of data loss in the event of hardware failures or other catastrophic events.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch clusters may expose sensitive audit log data to unauthorized access or tampering, necessitating robust security measures and access controls.

This decision to use Elasticsearch as the database for the Audit Log API aligns with the system's requirements for scalability, real-time search, and advanced analysis capabilities, while acknowledging potential challenges and risks associated with managing Elasticsearch clusters.
