## MVP
TBD
## Estimation
To estimate the time required for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development, let's break down the work and consider various factors:
### Development Effort
With 3 pairs of developers working full-time (40 hours per week), assuming each pair works independently, we have a total of 6 developers.
Considering pair programming and collaboration, we'll estimate a productivity factor of around 80% (accounting for meetings, breaks, coordination, etc.).
### Quality Assurance (QA) Effort
With 2 QA engineers, they will be involved in test planning, test case development, test execution, and bug reporting.
Assuming QA activities are conducted in parallel with development, we'll allocate a similar productivity factor of 80%.
### DevOps and System Administration Effort
2 DevOps engineers and 1 system administrator will handle infrastructure setup, CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, monitoring, and maintenance.
These tasks will run in parallel with development and QA efforts.
### UI/UX Design Effort
2 UI/UX designers will work on creating wire-frames, prototypes, and design assets.
Design tasks may precede development but will continue iteratively throughout the development process.
### Other Roles
The project manager, technical writer, and customer support team will provide support, documentation, and coordination throughout the project.

Now, let's estimate the time required for each role to contribute to the MVP development.

| Activity                       | Capacity                                        | Work hours |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Development                    | 6 developers * 40 hours/week * 80% productivity |192 hours/week |
| QA                             | 2 QA engineers * 40 hours/week * 80% productivity |64 hours/week |
| DevOps and System Administration| 3 team members * 40 hours/week * 80% productivity |96 hours/week |

Other Roles (project manager, technical writer, customer support) will contribute throughout the development process but may not require full-time dedication.


Given these estimates, let's assume a 40-hour workweek for each role. The total available effort per week for development, QA, DevOps, and design combined is 416 hours (192 + 64 + 96 + 64).
To estimate the time required for MVP development, divide the total MVP effort by the weekly available effort:
Total MVP effort / Total available weekly effort = Time to develop MVP
It's important to note that the actual time to develop the MVP may vary based on factors such as the complexity of features, dependencies, and unforeseen issues. Iterative development and agile practices can help adapt to changes and prioritize features effectively.
