We will use the following approaches for Continous Integration and Continous Delivery:

### Continuous Integration (CI):
- Developers commit their changes to the trunk frequently, ideally multiple times a day.
- Automated CI pipelines are triggered on every commit to the trunk.
- CI pipelines include tasks such as compiling code, running tests, performing code analysis, and creating build artifacts.

### Feature Flags:
- Features are developed incrementally and hidden behind feature flags in the trunk.
- Feature flags allow incomplete or experimental features to be safely deployed to production but hidden from users until they are ready.
- Feature flags are toggled on or off dynamically, allowing developers to control the rollout of features independently of deployment.

### Short-Lived Feature Branches:
- For larger or more complex features, developers create short-lived feature branches off the trunk.
- Feature branches are merged back into the trunk as soon as the feature is completed and tested.
- Feature branches should be kept small and focused to minimize integration conflicts and ensure fast feedback loops.

### Continuous Deployment (CD):
- The trunk is continuously deployed to a staging or pre-production environment after passing automated tests in the CI pipeline.
- Automated deployment pipelines deploy the trunk to staging environments multiple times a day.
- Staging environments closely mirror production environments to catch issues early in the deployment process.

### Automated Testing:
- Automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, are run as part of the CI pipeline.
- Tests should cover critical paths and edge cases to ensure the stability and reliability of the trunk.
- Tests should be fast-running to provide quick feedback to developers.

### Incremental Rollouts:
- Changes deployed to production are rolled out incrementally to mitigate risks.
- Canary deployments or phased rollouts are used to gradually expose changes to a subset of users before fully rolling out to all users.
- Monitoring and observability tools are used to track the performance and health of deployments in real-time.

### Feedback Loops:
- Continuous feedback loops are established to gather feedback from users, stakeholders, and monitoring systems.
- Feedback is used to iterate on features and improvements rapidly, driving continuous improvement.

### Rollback Strategies:
- Automated rollback mechanisms are in place to quickly revert changes in case of deployment failures or incidents.
- Rollback procedures are tested regularly to ensure they are reliable and effective.

### Documentation and Collaboration:
- Clear documentation and communication channels are established to keep all team members informed about changes and deployments.
- Collaboration tools such as code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge sharing sessions are used to ensure high-quality code and reduce integration issues.

### The big picture:

### Conclusion
By following this deployment strategy for trunk-based development, teams can achieve faster delivery cycles, higher code quality, and increased agility in responding to changing requirements and customer feedback.
