# Architecture Decision Record (ADR5)

## Title: Selection of Azure Database for PostgreSQL over Azure SQL Database

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
Our organization is in the process of selecting a database service for our microservices architecture on the Azure cloud platform. We are evaluating Azure SQL Database and Azure Database for PostgreSQL as potential options. Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service built on Microsoft SQL Server, while Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a managed service that provides a fully managed and scalable PostgreSQL database.

## Decision:
We have decided to use Azure Database for PostgreSQL as the primary database service for our microservices architecture. This decision is based on the following considerations:

1. **Open Source Compatibility:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL is fully compatible with open-source PostgreSQL, offering the same features, syntax, and tools. This ensures minimal changes to existing applications and simplifies migration to Azure.

2. **Developer Familiarity:** Many developers in our organization have experience with PostgreSQL, making Azure Database for PostgreSQL a natural choice. Leveraging PostgreSQL's familiarity reduces the learning curve for our development team and facilitates faster adoption of the database service.

3. **Flexibility:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers flexible scaling options, allowing us to adjust compute and storage resources based on workload demands. This scalability ensures that our database can handle varying levels of traffic and data volume efficiently.

4. **Ecosystem Integration:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL seamlessly integrates with other Azure services, enabling us to build and deploy cloud-native applications with ease. Integration with services such as Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) facilitates the development of modern, scalable applications.

5. **Community Support:** PostgreSQL has a large and active community of users and contributors, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support. This ensures that our team can access resources and expertise to troubleshoot issues and optimize database performance effectively.

6. **High Availability and Disaster Recovery:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL offers built-in high availability with automatic failover and geo-replication for disaster recovery. This ensures that our database remains accessible and resilient in the event of hardware failures or regional outages.

## Consequences:

**Positive:**
- **Compatibility:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL aligns with our organization's preference for open-source technologies and reduces vendor lock-in.
- **Developer Productivity:** Leveraging PostgreSQL's familiarity improves developer productivity and accelerates application development.
- **Scalability:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides flexible scaling options, ensuring that our database can handle future growth and workload fluctuations effectively.

**Negative:**
- **Feature Parity:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL may have differences in features and capabilities compared to Azure SQL Database. We will need to evaluate and address any gaps in functionality during implementation.
- **Tooling and Ecosystem Differences:** Our team may need to adapt to differences in tooling and ecosystem between PostgreSQL and SQL Server. Training and documentation updates may be required to support the transition.

**Risks:**
- **Migration Complexity:** Migrating existing applications or databases from SQL Server to PostgreSQL may introduce complexity and require careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition.
- **Performance Considerations:** We will need to carefully evaluate and optimize performance for our workload on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, considering factors such as query performance, indexing strategies, and resource utilization.
