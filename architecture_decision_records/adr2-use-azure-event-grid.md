# Architecture Decision Record (ADR2)

## Decision: Utilize Azure Event Grid for Event-Driven Architecture

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
The system needs to support asynchronous communication between microservices to ensure loose coupling and flexibility in a cloud environment.

## Decision:
We will use Azure Event Grid as the central event ingestion and processing service. It has native integration with Azure services, including functions and microservices deployed on AKS, enabling efficient and reliable asynchronous communication through events. Each microservice will publish events to Event Grid, and other microservices and functions will subscribe to these events for processing.

## Consequences:
**Positive:** 
- Loose coupling between microservices facilitates flexibility and scalability, enabling seamless integration and communication across the system.

**Negative:** 
- Complexity in managing event routing and subscription configurations may increase operational overhead.

**Risks:** 
- Dependency on Azure Event Grid for inter-service communication may introduce potential latency and reliability issues if not properly configured and monitored.
