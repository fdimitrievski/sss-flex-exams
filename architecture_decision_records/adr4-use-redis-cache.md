# Architecture Decision Record (ADR4)

## Decision: Implement Azure Redis for Caching

### Status: Accepted

## Context:
The exam system requires efficient caching mechanisms to improve performance, reduce latency, and handle high volumes of concurrent requests during exam sessions.

## Decision:
Azure Redis will be implemented as the caching solution for the exam system. Azure Redis provides a highly available and scalable caching service that can handle large volumes of data and concurrent requests with low latency.

## Consequences:
**Positive:**
- Improved Performance: Azure Redis offers in-memory caching, significantly reducing data retrieval times and improving overall system performance.
- Scalability: Azure Redis is a fully managed service that can scale horizontally to accommodate increasing load and data volume without manual intervention.
- High Availability: Azure Redis provides built-in replication and failover capabilities, ensuring high availability and reliability for critical exam system operations.
- Data Persistence: Azure Redis supports both in-memory and disk-based persistence options, ensuring data durability and recovery in case of failures.
- Integration with Azure Services: Azure Redis seamlessly integrates with other Azure services, enabling easy deployment, monitoring, and management within the Azure ecosystem.

**Negative:**
- Cost: While Azure Redis offers high performance and scalability, it comes with associated costs based on usage and data storage, which should be carefully monitored and managed to avoid unexpected expenses.
- Complexity: Implementing and managing Azure Redis requires expertise in caching strategies, configuration settings, and monitoring practices, which may introduce complexity for development and operations teams.

**Risks:**
- Data Consistency: Inadequate cache management strategies or configuration settings could lead to data inconsistency issues between the cache and the underlying data sources, impacting exam system functionality and reliability.
- Security: Misconfigured access controls or insecure data transmission could pose security risks, such as unauthorized access or data breaches, compromising the integrity and confidentiality of exam-related data.
