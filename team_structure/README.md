## Team Structure

### Development Team

#### Software Engineers (Pairs) 
Work in pairs to develop and maintain features, fix bugs, and implement improvements. Each pair consists of two developers with complementary skills who collaborate closely on coding tasks.
#### Technical Lead/Architect
Provides technical guidance, sets coding standards, reviews code, and ensures architectural coherence across the system. Facilitates pair programming sessions and mentors junior developers.
#### Quality Assurance Engineers
Collaborate with development pairs to define test cases, automate testing processes, and ensure software quality. Conduct code reviews, perform regression testing, and identify areas for improvement.

### Operations Team

#### DevOps Engineers
Manage infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and release processes. Automate deployment, monitoring, and scaling of software components. Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure as code (IaC).
#### System Administrators
Monitor system health, performance, and security. Respond to incidents, troubleshoot issues, and ensure high availability of services. Maintain backups, disaster recovery plans, and security protocols.

### Product Management and Design

#### Product Manager
Define product vision, roadmap, and priorities based on user feedback and business objectives. Collaborate with stakeholders to gather requirements, prioritize features, and plan releases.
#### UX/UI Designers
Create intuitive user interfaces, wireframes, and prototypes. Conduct user research, usability testing, and design reviews to ensure a seamless user experience. Collaborate closely with development pairs to implement designs.

### Support and Customer Success

#### Customer Support Specialists
Provide first-line support to users, troubleshoot issues, and escalate complex problems to development teams. Maintain a knowledge base and FAQs to assist users with common inquiries.
#### Customer Success Managers
Build relationships with customers, gather feedback, and advocate for user needs within the development team. Ensure timely resolution of customer issues and facilitate communication between users and development teams.

### Project Management

#### Scrum Master/Project Manager
